    <Entry Name="Note_CH01L03_VillageTales_Text">Altstadt and Brennenburg Castle 1801[br][br]Another region rich with lore is Altstadt, deep within the East Prussian woods. For centuries there have been stories surrounding the hamlet and its neighbor, castle Brennenburg. The quiet forest-clad mountains dressed with scattered lakes is as picturesque as can be, albeit the area is haunted by the dark. Ask any local and you will hear proof of the widespread superstition. All travelers should indulge themselves in such conversations since it will certainly serve as exciting entertainment. All of them have their own twists on the tales, but there are some motifs that keep reappearing.[br][new_page][br]The Gatherers[br][br]This story reaches all the way back to the time of the Thirty Years' War. It is said that soldiers who abandoned their duty got lost in the cold dark woods and were forever damned to roam the grounds. Their bodies wrought by their tainted souls have left them disfigured and empty of essence. Many have sighted them over the years and describe them as horrid revenants. They move silently through the woods, shying away from any beholder. They are called Gatherers as they seem to follow some ambition to steal living creatures. It is their prey which can be heard struggling inside damp burlap sacks dragged behind them which reveal their presence. What dark scheme do they follow?[br][new_page][br]A Visit Undone[br][br]Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, the well known erudite, visited Altstadt at the start of the 16th century. He resided in the local inn for a fortnight as he looked for remnants of kingdoms past. During his stay all the prominent members of society paid notice and he is mentioned in many records of the time. One day he went to investigate a burrow in the northwestern glades only to never be seen again. Heinrich is known to have passed away in Grenoble some ten years later. He dismissed the notion of ever visiting Altstadt, which makes you wonder what really happened. Who was this mysterious man who visited the sleepy hamlet in the woods and what happened to him?[br][new_page][br]The Immortal Baron[br][br]The Baron of Brennenburg lives a reclusive life with his family at his castle nearby Altstadt and like most those of noble birth, rumors are inherited alongside with the title. Researching the history reveals little before the castle was consumed by fire in the late 16th century. It was rebuilt by Alexander, a nobleman from the Rhinelands claiming the role as protector of the Prussian State. Alexander helped the region to flourish and remained popular throughout his presumed lifetime. The family has always been secretive when it comes to lineage and heritage, therefore the birth and death of Alexander and his offspring has never been fully recorded. This has fed the idea that the baron is in fact the one and the same who came from the West over three hundred years ago, lived through the time of occupation, and joined the coveted order of the Black Eagle along with the great leaders of this country.</Entry>

I need to lock Wilhelm and his men up to avoid further investigation from the public. The wine cellar will therefore be sealed off until the matter has been handled. Either the king's men leave or they will starve. Whatever comes first - they can rot for all I care.[br][br]Maybe I will feed them some wine, it would in a sense solve both of my problems.</Entry>

As most of the aristocracy, I was curious about what this supposed knight of the Order could want from me and accepted the invitation. The baron was friendly and offered me a proposition.[br][br]It dawned on me that the nature of the contract was sordid and that the reason I was chosen was because of the follies of my past and not the honors I've been rewarded with during my time as a soldier. I was to kidnap healthy humans upon his slightest whim and do so without asking questions. In return he would attest to my character at the royal court, advancing my position within noble society. I would like to claim that I struggled with my decision, but it came swiftly and I accepted wholeheartedly.[br][br]Ever since that day I've brought men, women, and children to Brennenburg. I can't remember the numbers, but there were many, perhaps even a hundred. None of whom were ever seen or heard from again.[br][br]Tonight the baron invited me and my men down to the wine cellar to celebrate our work. I had my suspicions as we descended the stairs, but he insisted and joined us in a toast. The wine tasted fine and my men drank without restraint.[br][br]So begins the punishment for our sins. The baron has locked us up and returned upstairs. Forgive me for what I have done. I was weak and fell into his diabolic ways. My men are screaming, their skin has been pierced by their own tangled bones. I feel my insides revolt against their God given nature.

    <Entry Name="Note_CH01L11_AccountOfHowling_Text">To my most trusted student and friend Johann Weyer.[br][br]The most remarkable thing happened as I was traveling through the Prussian woods this summer. I finally found one of the orbs I have been looking for the last twenty odd years. It is as inexplicable as the Heliodromus described it in the Hortus Conclusus. It was as it was told about, an underground Mithraic temple crowned with the unearthly artifact. The orb was big enough to fill my cupped hands and the texture was smooth and jagged - its color washed while rich. Contrast is not enough to describe its nature. It was an impossibility, an artificial paradox captured within stone.[br][br]I was staying in a nearby village called Altstadt, investigating one of the antiquated trails, when I finally found the cavern. I went inside and suddenly I could verify the truth of these enigmatic artifacts - they were real.[br][br]As you can understand, this is the most important discovery of my life, but it has also become my greatest fear. As I entered the underground chamber I could feel that I was trespassing. Because of my curiosity I did my best to fight these instincts and fetched the orb from its place. I scrambled out of the chamber and into the woods. I could sense something was following me, it bayed loudly as it closed in. The beast, this guardian of the orb, was relentless in its pursuit. [br][br]I made my way to a nearby ravine where I stumbled upon some men fishing in the lake. I tried to warn them as I passed, but fortunately they remained as I continued my escape. When I heard their cry of pain echo through the valley, I felt such a tremendous sense of relief, thinking I would be spared.[br][br]Suddenly a blue shimmering light engulfed me and the colors of the forest were washed away before my eyes. I kept running through the bleak surroundings, the trees had turned charcoal black with leaves of cinder, the ground covered in murky water. I pressed on through the drenched land as the glowing ember gave way to the rising wind and rained on me. I could hear pleading screams in the distance and I joined in as pain and fear overtook me. I fell to the ground gasping for air.[br][br]This certainly must sound strange, but I had been carried miles away across the Alps to a grassy field outside Genoa. The guardian had taken the orb from me, but still until this day I fear its return. Sometimes I lay awake at night listening for the howling cry I heard in the forest. It has been nearly a decade since that day and I still haven't been able to write about the incident.[br][br]The last time we spoke you told me about your interest and ongoing research into the mythic orbs and I realized I owed you the truth about my visit to Altstadt.[br][br][br]Your friend and mentor,[br]Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa.</Entry>

He was obviously excited to get going and we headed downstairs to the old dungeon where he preferred to attempt his rituals.[br][voice Diary_CH01L16_Daniel0601_03.ogg][br]It turns out that Alexander is a true Renaissance man, paralleled only by Da Vinci, I'm sure. He showed me several rooms fitted for specific research such as anatomy studies, alchemy, and botany. The crown of Brennenburg must be the Inner Sanctum, a most hallowed ground, where we shall attempt to permanently banish the Orb's Shadow.</Entry>

Using my Orb, Alexander managed to channel its power unto us. The Inner Sanctum flared with blue fiery light and I could feel the same things I felt in the dark chamber in Algeria. It was like standing in a mad whirlpool of impressions. It was terrifying, but Alexander kept calm and wielded strange tools of science in order to tame the storm. [br][voice Diary_CH01L16_Daniel0602_02.ogg][br]Suddenly the blue light was stained by strains of red and the walls burst with pulsating tissue resonating with the scene. Alexander quickly covered the Orb in some cloth and the unspeakable thing vanished. Apparently, the Orb's Shadow is closer than Alexander thought. He said I should prepare for a warding ritual tomorrow. I'm not sure what he expects, but I have a bad feeling about this.</Entry>

How an enlightened man can show such lack of compassion in a seat of power disgusts me. I can't bring myself to part from Agrippa as he is and has been for centuries my only link to the worlds beyond.[br][br]Weyer claims he tries his best to release me from my banishment, but that he needs me to give him Agrippa first so he too can help.

I know what they are capable of, I have seen their deception.[br]Optimism is a most hopeless feeling, but I must retain it. I shall prepare for his release.[br][br]To release Agrippa without killing him, Weyer told me to feed him a tonic made from a paralyzer, vitae, and Tampter. [br][br]The poisonous fungi should work as a paralyzer if I can find the internal gland from a large specimen. The Choir seems to be a fertile grounds for this sort. I should then be able to extract its contents with the proper tools.[br][br]The vitae could be extracted as usual from any agonized human victim's blood. I just need large amounts to distill it properly. Remember to collect this during the next torture session. [br][br]Tampter on the other hand will prove more difficult. I don't think it exists in this world. Simply writing the word with these letters looks wrong. I believe it's a property of the secretion in the water dwelling Kaernk.

    <Entry Name="Note_CH02L23_AlexTorture_Text">There are quite a few things to be said about torture. I had figured that the reaction I would get from the victims would be highly individual. Thankfully this is not the case. The humans all have a very similar approach to dealing with physical pain and the terror of anticipation. [br][br]I can't stress enough the importance of restraining the victims before proceeding. Even the most timid creature can break out in fits of violence where their strength exceeds their expected prowess. If proper care has been put into breaking the victim, this should not be a problem, but it will also hinder the effect I am after. The right steps to take are, therefore: to restrain while the victim is still dazed, proceed by presenting the form of torture you are about to apply,and then to continue with the actual act. [br][br]The point of presentation is to infuse terror. The human mind is extremely efficient, as it will trigger itself into greater fear simply by imagining it. While applying pain, make sure to avoid massive damage as it will prove more efficient if the process can be sustained. Also, apply the pain in doses, if possible with breaks to let the body settle. If you are whipping or cutting the victim, strike once, wait for the pain to subdue, then strike again.[br][br]As long as the body suffers it will continue to produce the vitae and saturate the blood with its properties. Only with careful performance will the victim yield maximum effect. If the victim doesn't behave as expected, it is likely that all will be for nought. Before this happens, feed them the Amnesia drink and try again later.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_PulledLever_01">What lever? Oh, that one. So many of Alexander's things are breaking down. Look around, maybe the other room.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_SafetyDoors_01">You got the doors open? Good going. I knew you could do it.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_MissedOrbs_01">I see you have found some orb pieces, but there should be more. Alexander would most likely keep them close to torture contraptions.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_MissedOrbs_02">Check the Choir and Transept for more.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_ChoirDone_01">Looks like you cleaned out the Choir. Head for the Transept and find the rest of the orb pieces.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_TranseptDone_01">You seem to have found all the orb pieces used in the Transept. Go to the Choir and find the rest.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_AllOrbsNotIngred_01">I see you have all the orb pieces you need. I know I have no right to ask anything of you.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_AllOrbsNotIngred_02">But if you can find it in your heart to gather the ingredients for Weyer's tonic before attempting to mend the orb, there might still be a chance for you to save me.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_AllOrbsNotIngred_03">Please, my fate is in your hands.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_AllOrbs_01">You have everything. What are you waiting for? Head towards the Chancel and find a way into the laboratory.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_AllOrbs_02">Inside, you should be able to produce the tonic Weyer talked about.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random01_01">Who, me? I am Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa. I was once quite important, you know.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random01_02">Baron Alexander has sustained my soul in this dead husk for years. Who knows how many... hundreds I presume.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random02_01">Alexander is quite impressive in many ways. But he has grown impatient.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random03_01">Why me? I'm the next best thing. Alexander really wanted none other than Johann Weyer.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random03_02">You never heard of Johann Weyer?! My God, boy! He is probably the greatest man in history and you don't know him?!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random03_03">Or is it the world who has forgotten him?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random04_01">Weyer was my pupil - my pupil.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random04_02">Yes, I do take pride in that fact. Is it so wrong?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random05_01">I found a Mithraeum once. One which had not been plundered. Do you know of Mithraism?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random05_02">I suppose it doesn't matter. It's an old faith building temples out of caverns. The dark walls inside being the universe and inside are its followers... humans watching the sky slowly turn.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random05_03">But the followers do have one thing to allow them a sense of connection to creation... the Orbs.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random06_01">Not many orbs are left. They sometimes consume themselves or break when used by an uninitiated.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random06_02">I was lucky. The Orb I found spared my life and returned to where I had found it. I know, because Alexander took it and brought it to Brennenburg.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random07_01">Weyer was a brave man and dared to proceed where I did not. He unearthed a number of cavern temples and gathered a whole collection of Orbs.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random07_02">But unlike every other finder since the fall of the Mithraic faith, he was able to unshackle the horror you and I connect with the Orbs. He used them and was able to travel far and wide. Beyond the world itself.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random08_01">Me, powerful? Not the way I had hoped for. I have done all that I can to escape this prison, but now I use all my strength merely to stay alive.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random09_01">My pupil, Johann Weyer, said he had found a way to take me with him beyond the stars.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random09_02">But I was too afraid to come along. Silly really... and now all I can do is regret it.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random10_01">I have always hoped Weyer would return and give me a second chance. But so does Alexander, that's why he keeps me here... as a hostage in hope Weyer will reveal himself.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random11_01">You are a good boy, Daniel, and I appreciate your company, but I believe you have more important things to care of.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Agrippa_Nrm_Random12_01">You should hurry, Daniel. No time for sitting around.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_Alexander_01">Daniel. You have gone too far. I have to stop you. I can't let you proceed any further. I'm sorry, my friend.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L22_Alexander_01">Is this guilt I'm witnessing, Daniel? If so, blame yourself. You started this.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L22_Alexander_02">You sent me that letter asking for help and this is how you repay me? How dare you?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L24_Alexander_01">What are my intentions, Daniel?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L24_Alexander_02">Salvation. It used to be yours. But now you only seek misplaced revenge. How do you justify your violence? Is it for the greater good? Are you doing the world a service?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L24_Alexander_03">It is you who caused all this pain and death. If you had accepted your fate and submitted to the Orb when your first discovered it, none of this would have happened.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L24_Alexander_04">It is curiosity in league with your selfishness that is killing us both.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L25_Alexander_01">You had me worried. Quite frankly, I'm not sure what to do with you.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L25_Alexander_02">I hold no grudge against you, Daniel. We are so very much the same, you and I.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L25_Alexander_03">Did you really drink from the Amnesia mixture?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L25_Alexander_04">It does explain so much of your behavior. You never did finish what you set out to do.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L25_Alexander_05">You talked about redemption. How you would face the Orb's shadow and save our work - and me?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L25_Alexander_06">I will grant you another chance to redeem yourself. You can wait here and stop the shadow.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L25_Alexander_07">Thank you - friend.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH01_DanielRamble_01">You have to get out of here...</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH01_DanielRamble_02">That taste... that fragrance... Damascus Rose.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH01_DanielRamble_03">What... what is... this place?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH01_DanielRamble_04">The darkness... closing in...</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH01_DanielRamble_05">It's cold... it's so cold.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="CH01_DanielRamble_08">The flicker... the bluish light.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH01_DanielRamble_09">Getting closer... somehow.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH01_DanielRamble_10">What was that?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH01_DanielRamble_11">Someone's coming...</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH01_DanielRamble_12">This shouldn't be...</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH01_DanielRamble_13">Is anyone there?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_01">What happened to her?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_02">Maybe she knows...</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_03">All dressed in blue...</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_04">...that shimmering blue light.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_05">Just like Regent's Park.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_06">Is she dead?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_07">Help her. Find a way.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_08">No, don't kill her.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_09">The shadow... it's close now.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_10">Find her...!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_11">Get her back.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_12">She deserved it, that little... bitch.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_13">Do whatever it takes.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02_DanielRamble_14">Who are you to question me?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03_DanielRamble_01">Shouldn't trust him.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03_DanielRamble_02">He is lying.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03_DanielRamble_03">He sees what I see.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03_DanielRamble_04">Get away, you shouldn't do that!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03_DanielRamble_05">Should kill them all. Burn this castle to the ground.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03_DanielRamble_06">He'll never see it coming.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03_DanielRamble_07">Crush his skull. He deserves it.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03_DanielRamble_08">The blood... use it for the ritual.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_Return_01">Daniel! I thought I had lost you. The castle trembled and I could hear the Chancel collapse...</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_Return_02">The laboratory might be accessible now.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_Return_03">Make haste. You are more than ready to make the tonic. Go on, you should find everything you need in the laboratory.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_PotionNotStart_01">What are you doing? Time is running short.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_PotionNotStart_02">Hurry, you'll find everything you need in the laboratory.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_PotionDone_01">You did it. Thank goodness!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_PotionDone_02">Now, pay attention. First feed me the tonic and then use the saw to remove my head.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_PotionDone_03">As the tonic begins to work you will be able to cut off my head without taking my life.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_PotionDone_04">Then take my head and bring it with you as you enter the gate Alexander is opening in the Inner Sanctum.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_PotionDone_05">What do you mean? Why wouldn't you enter the gate?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_PotionGiven_02">And Daniel, whatever happens - get me through that gate.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_PotionDone_06">We can't argue now - you need to act.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_SawNoPotion_01">Don't get ahead of yourself. First we need the tonic.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L26_Agrippa_Nrm_PotionGiven_01">Quickly! Off with the head!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_ArriveHead_01">I was wondering if you were going to show up.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_ArriveNoHead_01">It saddens me to see you filled with such hate. Is vengeance really what you seek?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_ArriveNoHead_02">I hoped you of all could appreciate the grave nature of the situation. After all, it has always been your life we were fighting for.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_ArriveNoHead_03">Isn't it worth a little... sacrifice?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_ArriveNoHead_04">Come, help me finish the ritual. There is still time before the shadow catches up with you.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_ArriveHead_02">I see Agrippa convinced you to run some errands. Tell me, is everything nice and clear now? Am I the villain?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_ArriveHead_03">Good and evil. Such comforting concepts - but hardly applicable.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_ArriveHead_04">Are you so blind that you see no good in me? Or evil in Agrippa?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_AlmostDone_01">I realize, you doubt my intentions. Why would I take such extreme measures to save your life?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_AlmostDone_02">Maybe I'm saving mine too.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_AlmostDone_03">I'm just like you, Daniel. A prisoner of circumstance. Trapped in a world I no longer recognize.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_AlmostDone_04">As you gain your freedom, will you deny me mine?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_AlmostDone_05">We are close now. Closer than I've been for centuries.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_PortalOpens_01">Do you see, Daniel? A whole other world - isn't it beautiful? I can finally return... home.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_PortalOpens_02">But you... I am sorry Daniel. You won't be able to enter. You are still tainted - branded by the Shadow. It will consume you either way.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_Interrupt01_01">No, don't do that.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_Interrupt02_01">Stop it Daniel, you are ruining it.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_Interrupt02_02">We are so close - I beg you.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_Interrupt03_01">No, you fool!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_Interrupt03_02">You killed us - you killed us both!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Ending_Alexander_01">Thank you, my friend.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Ending_Alexander_02">Your sacrifice won't be forgotten. You will be celebrated... forever.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Ending_Daniel_01">It was my greatest triumph.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Ending_Daniel_02">... and I never looked back.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Ending_Daniel_03">You think I was afraid fleeing Brennenburg? Quite the contrary.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Ending_Daniel_04">I knew that it was my purgatory - hellfire made to wash away my sins.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Ending_Daniel_05">There's no denying the things I've done. But I have paid my tribute. I gave them that awful man...</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Ending_Daniel_06">... I did the right thing.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Alexander_AgrippaEnd_01">No, you fool! You have ruined us!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Ending_Agrippa_01">There he is. Do you see him, Weyer? He deserves so much more.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Ending_Agrippa_02">Please help him, I know you can.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH03L29_Ending_Agrippa_03">Don't worry, Daniel. It will be alright.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="CH02L15_PrisonerCaptured_02">Christ - I don't believe this. Why... I mean why? What did I do to deserve this? I mean, it can't be... do I deserve this?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L15_PrisonerCaptured_03">It wasn't my fault!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L15_PrisonerCaptured_04">Why did he have to go in there? You don't go into burning houses. He should have known better.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L16_JourneyToSanctum05_01">So, you use the drain sewers as a means of transport?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L16_JourneyToSanctum05_02">Yes - they were built to divert water from an underground spring and are quite spacious.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L16_JourneyToSanctum05_03">It seemed only natural to incorporate it in the overall structure.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L16_JourneyToSanctum05_04">But we won't be using it.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L16_JourneyToSanctum05_05">Not today. The flow is seasonal and when the spring runs dry the damp tunnels produce a rather poisonous type of fungi.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L16_JourneyToSanctum05_06">There is an antidote of course - but we won't be bothering with it today. Come, this way instead. We are almost there.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L18_CisternVisit_01">You are conserving water from the spring.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L18_CisternVisit_02">Yes, it enables me to control the water in the drain sewers to some extent. Also, it can be used for all sorts of purposes.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L18_CisternVisit_03">Like for drinking.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L18_CisternVisit_04">Well, that too. But mostly to run different machines.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="CH02L19_MorgueVisit_06">Yes, let's. Where to?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L19_MorgueVisit_07">Just down the corridor. To the morgue.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="CH02L21_WaitRoom_01">These cells are meant to hold prisoners who are under treatment. The people you send for will end up here.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_WaitRoom_02">Remember that the confinement itself works as a preamble to the torture and you should pace yourself. Don't take anyone before they are ready.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_WaitRoom_03">Understood.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_WaitRoom_04">Sounds from the torture chambers are shuttled in through those pipes in the ceiling. Manage your victims well and let one prisoner's pain instill terror in his cellmate.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L21_PrisonerWaitRoom_01">I know this. I've been here already. I know this taste - the taste of Damascus Rose obfuscating the truth in a dim haze.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="CH01L03_MapRoom_03">There isn't much to be done about the wards. We should reinforce weak structures. The ground will tremble and there is a risk everything will cave in on us - especially downstairs.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="Random_Nightmares_04">Yes, I can't shake them. They come every night.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Random_Nightmares_05">We'll put a stop to them. You'll see.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Random_Mirage01_01">Don't forget your bag, Daniel.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Random_Mirage01_02">I won't, Herbert.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Random_Mirage01_03">There is no shame in using a parasol in the desert. As it happens, it's imperative to your survival.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Random_Mirage01_04">But it looks ridiculous.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Random_Mirage01_05">The shame will hurt much less than dying, I assure you.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Random_Mirage02_01">Herbert, how did we find this place?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Random_Mirage02_02">An old friend back in Algiers gave me a map.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Random_Mirage02_03">Why isn't he with us? Didn't he want to come?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Random_Mirage02_04">He wanted to, Daniel. But things don't always turn out the way we plan.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L24_TortureWheel_01">The wheel is good for keeping your victim still during the procedure. They can be bound around the circumference or simply stretched across, tying limbs to the spokes and rim.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L24_TortureWheel_02">All tools are, by this point, useful and you may administer the torture in any way you like. But the forte of the wheel is the gaps.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L24_TortureWheel_03">When you have decided that the victim shall die you can smash their limbs with a hammer, making them fold in between the frame.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L24_TortureWheel_04">But they'll die - too quickly I mean.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L24_TortureWheel_05">No, don't worry. The human body is much more resilient. They can survive for days until they finally succumb.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="CH02L23_PrisonerCage_01">How much more, Baron?! How much more am I supposed to withstand? Kill me already - kill me!</Entry>

I weep for them, they lust for power without restraint, where I only crave fair judgment and a safe return.</Entry>

[br][br]I have done so much for you and I have gained nothing in return. Agrippa, I trusted you. It was I who in all fairness should have entered that gate.</Entry>

Once in a while someone will notice me and lose themselves in a silent cower before regaining their senses.[br][br]They all know I am the one and the same Alexander who helped their fathers and grandfathers to found this great Order. I've seen them take their fathers' places, and they too will grow old and pass away. While I remain the same, aged not by time, but by anguish.</Entry>

I am a monster to them, a demonic sultan perched on a dark mountain top. There is little I can do to redeem myself.[br] [br]The Black Eagle fears me and after Napoleon's defeat it is only a matter of time before they will demand my head on a platter. I must remove myself from this land. This time it must work. If I can't return home now, I shall perish.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="Ch01_Beginning01">The door slammed shut behind him and he knew he would never again see the old tailor at Berkeley Square. Another lone soul in London - seemed appropriate somehow.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch01_Beginning02">The other children cheered him on. His name voiced in a steadily rising pace, urging him to do it. "Am I really doing this?", the young boy thought and struck his victim with a rock.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch01_Beginning03">He fell to the kitchen floor. Tears were beginning to well in his eyes as he received the first kick in his stomach. Hazel remained hidden, in fear she too would be punished.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="Ch02_Diary05_02">The morning sun flickered between the pine trees as the carriage approached the castle. A faint memory of reflections in the window pane repeated itself over and over.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Diary05_03">Moving that orb was like pushing a star in the night sky. It wasn't supposed to happen. The Shadow isn't some vengeful spirit, it is the universe catching up with itself.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Diary06_01">The beautiful wild orchid seemed a testament to nature's strength, being able to grow inside Brennenburg. Alas, it was Alexander's studies and care which enabled the flower to blossom.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Diary06_02">The purpose of the Inner Sanctum had always been to study the orbs and find a way to force them to yield their power. However, he was still unaware of this.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="Ch01_Diary01_04">The desert dunes were like waves in a sluggish sea. While the caravan moved the land appeared motionless, but in camp the hills moved.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch01_Diary01_05">A handful of sand trickled from the crumbling stone ceiling and pushed down on the brim of his hat. He braced himself as the cavern suddenly shifted and settled.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch01_Diary01_06">The stone slab looked like a safety measure. It wasn't meant to be moved ever again.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch01_Diary02_03">It became impossible to avoid. The commotion in the streets begged for his attention. As he opened the shutters the French soldiers opened fire on the two young men fighting back. Their voices were silenced in a haze of gun smoke.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch01_Diary02_04">He sat down by the Casbah wall gasping for air. Sweat poured from his forehead and onto the sand veiled ground.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch01_Diary03_04">The thin cold mist brushed his face as he stepped outside. London weather could be cruel, but it was the kind of cruelty he could handle.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch01_Diary03_05">He climbed out of bed and looked out the window. It was completely dark. He waited, glanced at the old clock, and waited some more. Four o' clock, he thought, it's enough.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch01_Diary03_06">He tried to fit the pieces together, but like the sand dunes, they shifted when you weren't looking.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch01_Diary04_04">The strange letter frightened him, but it was also the only one which offered some comfort.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch01_Diary04_05">He flipped through the Book of Monarchs looking for etchings and counted. Nine different kings from all over Europe had been depicted with an orb resting in their hands.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Prison01">He wasn't particularly afraid of the dark, but he had always disliked going into the basement. His father urged him on to fetch the red dye. As he stepped into the dark, he thought, "I will never escape this".</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Prison02">The blue colored tint came crashing down. His father heard the jar break and yelled from upstairs. There was no need for punishment. He could already feel the sting of his father's belt.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Prison03">He cried like the little boy he was. All alone in the dark basement, broken glass tearing at the flesh of his naked feet, and blood mixed with blue tint.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Sewer01">Henry Bedloe went to class carrying the anger of his bitter mother. He never cried, he made others cry instead. Pain is like that, you either become sad or you become angry. Henry always chose the latter.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Sewer02">There is never any escape. Things like this live with you always. How could he know if Henry would show up down the road or even at his house? Is he that mad? Would he do that?</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch03_Captured01">Hazel spent all summer in bed. He used to read to her after helping father with his work. In his mind he was like Scheherazade, and as long as he kept telling the story she would not die.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch03_Captured02">When Hazel turned fifteen she had lived three years longer than doctor Tate had foreseen. Her parents had given up from exhaustion and decided to have her committed for permanent treatment at Canterbury Hospice, but she was still alive. She had embraced him and wished him a grand adventure in Algeria.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch03_Zimmerman01">Alexander became silent. He didn't know what to say. He could no longer recognize his friend sitting across the carriage.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch03_Zimmerman02">The crying had stopped and he could hear a whisper coming from the cell. They were up to something and he would have to punish them.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Diary05_04">Carefully treading the unknown land, he looked over his shoulder at his travel companions. The outrider touched the brim of his hat as a final farewell.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Diary05_05">He unraveled the cloth protecting the orb. Alexander reached out, picked it up, and held it up against the light. "Cover it", he said, "Keep it covered at all times".</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Diary05_06">The servants avoided him, yet he knew they were there. They all smelled of spiced wine, a mystic scent permeated by clove and sage.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Diary06_04">He waited for his eyes to adjust to the darkness, but no shape or contour appeared.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Diary06_05">The red taint burst from the walls as if they had begun to bleed. He cried out in fear as the spectacle began to consume the blue shimmer.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Diary06_06">Alexander knew there must be a way to finish the ritual before it was too late. He had to teach his friend to harvest the vitae. That much was certain.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Diary07_04">It had gone too far. The man was suffocating as he could no longer breathe properly between the lashes. Displeased, he started to look for the Damascus rose oil.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Diary07_05">The thick liquid spread across his tongue. He swallowed excessively to consume every drop. He looked through the window at the widespread forest and the morning sun. "Will this ever end?", he thought.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch02_Diary07_06">Carefully cutting the man open made him think, "This is how father must feel about his craft. Being an artisan, relying on one's skill to perform something so delicate, grants a certain form of pride".</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch03_Diary08_04">The sight of her lifeless body crippled his psyche. He tried to remove himself from the scene, but he could not. Instead he fell to his knees and begged her for forgiveness.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch03_Diary08_05">All his life he had thought that he was a good man. Terrible deeds were only committed by terrible people, like Henry Bedloe, the bully in school, but now he had seen what he himself could do.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="Ch03_Diary08_06">If it wasn't for Alexander, he would still be innocent and be able to die so.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="WelcomeDemo1">Welcome to Quartz and Cordite - Open beta Demo[br](a Wheezy Everlasting 2 release)[br][br]What you'll experience is a work in progress concept, full of possibilities for inconveniences and occasional bugs, continue with that in mind.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="WelcomeDemo2">The mod features a core shooting mechanic, which is heavily limited by the shortcomings of the HPL2 engine.[br][br]While I gave it my best shot to have the best player experience, it still yearns for improvements in future updates. Please follow some of the guidelines listed to avoid most of the misunderstandings regarding this feature. </Entry>
    <Entry Name="WelcomeDemo3">TIPS:[br][br]- The targeting system sometimes fails to recognize the object you're shooting at. Moving the mouse around often helps fixing it.[br][br]- The gun has slight aim assist for enemies. If you hover slowly around the enemies' silhoutte, you can get your aim centered to a point which is almost a sure hit.[br][br]- When you make a successful shot on an enemy, it bleeds with an effect. Use this as indication of a succesful shot![br][br]- Enemies have a random chance involved for landing the killing blow. If you run out of bullets it may be a good idea to retreat, and try again later. Sneaking is almost always a viable option as well![br][br]- You can also shoot containers and doors, but it's rarely worth spending your precious bullets on!</Entry>
    <Entry Name="WelcomeDemo4">The interplay between light and dark is very important to the game and because of this it is vital to set up the gamma correctly. Use the slider control below to do so. Adjust it until the square at the right is barely visible. [br][br][br]While the mod lacks a lantern, you can find various sources of light, so be on the lookout![br][br]Also make sure to play in a dark room and wear headphones for the best effect.</Entry>

    <Entry Name="WelcomeMessage03">Do not worry about when and how to save during gameplay, the game will take care of that for you. [br][br]When you want to leave the game, just choose "Save and Exit". You can then use "Continue" to return to where you left off next time you start up the game.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="WelcomeMessage04">The world of Amnesia is a dangerous place and you are extremely vulnerable. [br][br]Do not try to fight the enemies encountered. Instead, use your wits. Hide, or even run if necessary.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="WelcomeMessage05">The interplay between light and dark is very important to the game and because of this it is vital to set up the gamma correctly. Use the slider control below to do so. Adjust it until the square at the right is barely visible. [br][br]Also make sure to play in a dark room and wear headphones for the best effect.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="WelcomeMessage06">That is all. Hope you enjoy immersing yourself in the world of Amnesia.[br][br][br]- Frictional Games</Entry>

    <Entry Name="TortureText_Wheel">The murderer's limbs were tied to the spokes of the wheel. They turned the wheel slowly, but with intent so the rope secured around his leg stretched and cracked the bone. [br][br]He no longer had the strength to scream. The two men looked at each other knowingly and took a hammer and struck the victim's chest in a final act of mercy.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="TortureText_Maiden">The forger stood absolutely still. The casket had been closed but a faint light made its way inside. A myriad of spikes pointed at him. Glittering as they waited for his body to slip just for a moment. [br][br]His knee jerked and he felt blood trickle down his leg. In pain his head fell slightly forward. It took him a while to realize his eye had ruptured and begun to leak.</Entry>
    <Entry Name="TortureText_Bull">The traitor did not know what to think of the brass bull as he was forced to enter it. Only when the heat of fire began to scorch his skin and cook his flesh did he realize it was to be his tomb.[br][br]His screams of pain echoed inside the brass chamber and travelled through the complex instrument which was the bull's head. Outside the men could hear the brazen bull bellow.</Entry>
