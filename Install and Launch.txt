------ To install the mod:

- Copy the quartz_and_cordite folder
to your Main Amnesia/redist folder
(where Amnesia.exe is)

- If you want to try the 64 bit version
due to crashes or faster loading times,
download the Amnesia64 addon, and put the
exe filesunder the main/redist folder also.
(installation instructions for addon included)

------- To play:

- Go inside main-redist/quartz_and_cordite folder
- Click on the Quartz and Cordite.bat

If you want to play 64bit or NoSteam:
- Click on the other respective bat files.
- There is 64 bit support for steam and NoSteam as well.

NOTE:
- The 64 bit versions will not work without
the downloaded and installed addon from the
moddb page.
- THERE IS NO REASON normally to use the 64 bit exe,
unless you're facing issues. The mod should be
able to run perfectly on vanilla. 
The option is there as a failsafe, that is.
